# HOW TO RUN QUESTION 1
## On Windows OS:
1. After cloning the repository from GitHub, unzip the file in the desktop directory (For 
easy navigation). 
2. Open command prompt and navigate to the folder in the desktop directory that you've just unzipped.
3. Type 'conversionQ1.exe' to run the executable file. You should be able to see a message
asking you to type in an integer of your choice.

## On Mac OS:
1. After cloning the repository from GitHub, unzip the file in the desktop directory (For 
easy navigation). 
2. Open terminal and navigate to the folder in the desktop directory that you've just unzipped.
3. Since '.exe' files cannot run on Mac OS, you'll have to compile the '.cpp' file to
get an executable file compatible with your OS.
	- Assuming you already have a C++ compiler installed, type the following command:
	'g++ conversionQ1.cpp' to compile the C++ file. An executable file 'a.out' will be
	created. Type './a.out' to run the executable file. You should be able to see a message
	asking you to type in an integer of your choice.
	- If you do not have a C++ compiler installed, please refer to this
	 [link](http://www.edparrish.net/common/macgpp.php) for instructions on how to install the compiler.
